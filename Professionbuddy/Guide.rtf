\pard\widctlpar\ul\b\f0\fs28 Introduction\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\sa200\sl276\slmult1\ulnone\b0\fs24\lang9 Professionbuddy is a plugin designed to automate Tradeskill related tasks including but not limited to automatically leveling Tradeskills, disenchanting items, milling herbs or crafting a list of items.\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\sa200 Tasks are built by drag and dropping Actions  onto the right pane and editing the actions to the desired settings.The user can then save the tasks to a profile as well as load profiles. ProfessionBuddy supports loading .zip files as well as saving to .zip. When a profile is saved to a .zip file any Honorbuddy/GB gathering profiles that the ProfessionBuddy profile uses is automatically added to the zip. This makes distributing multiple files much easier.\par
Having basic knowledge of the C# language is recommended to build advanced profiles as well as some knowledge of Honorbuddy's API\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\sa200\cf0\f0\fs24\lang9\par

\pard\widctlpar\ul\b\fs28\lang1033 How do I make profiles?\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\sa200\ulnone\b0\fs24\lang9 You can drag and drop Actions from the Action List on the left to the Task List that's on the right side and then configure the action's settings to your likings in the PropertyGrid.\par
There is a wide variety of Actions to choose from such as actions that will craft recipes, mill,disenchant,prospect, fly or run to locations, train, sell/buy from vendors and AH and more. There's also an "If Condition" and "While Condition" that can be used to perform actions under certain conditions.\par
Once you have have all the actions that you need in the Task List hit the start button and Professionbuddy will perform all the actions in the Task List\par
In order to make advanced profiles like one that levels a profession you need to know basic C#. If you have some experience with making quest orders then this shouldn't be a problem.\par

\pard\widctlpar\ul\b\fs28\lang1033 Action Tab\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\sa200\ulnone\b0\fs24\lang9 This tab shows a list of actions that can be placed in the Task List via drag and drop or using that \lquote add\rquote  button. This list also includes an 'If Condition' which will execute all the actions it contains if the \i condition\i0  is true. \par

\pard\widctlpar\fs22  \ul\b\fs28\lang1033 Tradeskill Tab\fs22\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\sa200\ulnone\b0\fs24\lang9 This Tab contains all your current tradeskills and all the learned recipes you bot has learned. There's a search filter text box to the upper left corner and a drop-down list of Categories to the upper right.\par
The list has 3 different columns, Name, recipe repeatable count, and color representing the recipes difficulty. This list supports multiple selection which makes it easy to add allot of recipes to the Task list. To add the Recipes to the Task List you need to select them and then click the 'Add' button that is below the list.  To the left of the 'Add' button is a numeric value that represents the number of times the recipes will be repeated when added to the Task list.\par
To the right of the 'Add' button is a drop down list with different modes that will alter the recipe's repeat behavior. The 1st and default mode, \i 'Specific'\i0  will attempt to repeat the recipe the specified number of times. \par
The second mode \i 'Craftable'\i0  will repeat the recipe until it runs out of mats. \par
The third and final mode \i 'Banker'\i0  is only available if the user has an addon called DataStore installed. It's available on Curse gaming and comes with that Altaholic Addon. It basically keeps track of inventory, auctions, mail and bank items for all your characters, and even has multiple account support. This mode is nice to restock your bankers with crafted goods to sell on AH for example. It checks to see how many of the crafted items you have on your alts and then it deducts the \i 'Repeat'\i0  amount from it. For example if you had 12 Flask of Steelskin on your alts and your \i 'Repeat'\i0  number is 20 it would makes 8 flasks. (20-12 =8). \par

\pard\widctlpar\ul\b\fs28\lang1033 Task List\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\sa200\ulnone\b0\fs24\lang9 The Task List is where all your 'If Condition's and Actions are. To change the properties of an action you must select it and then change the settings in the Property grid below. There are several keybind that make editing easier.\par

\pard\widctlpar\ul\b\fs28\lang1033 Keybinds:\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\sa200\ulnone\fs24\lang9 Shift + drag n drop\b0 : By default dropping an action on top of an 'If condition' places it inside that 'If Condition' this keybind cancels that effect.\par
\b Ctrl + drag n drop: \b0 copies an action or an 'If Condition' and all of its actions\par
\b Delete: \b0 deletes selected action/If Condition\par
\b Esc: \b0 Clears current selection\par

\pard\widctlpar\ul\b\fs28\lang1033 Property Grid\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\sa200\ulnone\b0\fs24\lang9 This control shows the settings of the currently selected Action in the Task list. The settings are pretty much self-explanatory but if there's any doubt, check the actions detailed description below the Action list.\par
There is one common setting that might need an explanation, Location. The Location setting is used by many actions and it describes a location in the game. It accepts a HotSpot style Tag or any combination of 3 numbers and automatically converts them to the correct format. Also the button with 3 dots '...' will automatically place the location of the player in the text edit box or the player's current target's location if he/she has one.\par

\pard\widctlpar\ul\b\fs28\lang1033 API\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\sa200\ulnone\b0\fs24\lang9 I have added quite a few small helper API for use with the 'If/While Condition's and Custom Actions. They are there to serve as shortcuts. You can also use HB's api if needed.\par

\pard\widctlpar\ul\b\fs28\lang1033 If/While Condition\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\sa200\ulnone\b0\fs24\lang9 The \i 'If/While Condition'\i0\fs22\lang1033  will \fs24\lang9 runs the actions that they contain if an expression is true.\par
Execution starts from the top action and goes down the list of actions that the If/While Condition contains. If at any time the \i Condition\i0  becomes false then execution stops executing inside the If/While Condition\i  \i0 immediatly unless the property \i 'Ignore Condition Until done'\i0  is set to true in which case execution will ignore the \i Condition\i0  until it finishes executing the last action at the bottom of the If/While Condition\i  \i0\par
The \i While Condition\i0  will repeated execute a set of actions as long as its condition remains true.\par
A \i While condition\i0  can repeatedly execute actions within but the \i If Condition\ul\i0  \ulnone cannot (unless it's embedded within a \i While Condition\i0 )\par

\pard\widctlpar\ul\b\fs28 Custom Action\par
\ulnone\b0\fs22 A Custom action will execute a C# statement \par
\par
\ul\b\fs28 Declaration\par
\ulnone\b0\fs22 Declarations are used to define your own fields, properties, methods or other types\ul\b\fs28\par
\ulnone\b0\fs22\par
\ul\b\fs28\lang1033 SubRoutines\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\sa200\ulnone\b0\fs24\lang9 Subroutines can contain a group of actions that you can execute by using 'Call Subroutine' action. This allows you to have more compact and organized profiles\par

\pard\widctlpar\sa200\sl276\slmult1\ul\b\fs28\lang1033\par
Useful stuff to use in If/While Conditions, Wait and Custom Actions\par

\pard\widctlpar\lang9 Generic Tradeskill API \par

\pard\nowidctlpar\sa200\ulnone\b0\fs24 The following tradeskills are currently supported and have wrappers for them \par
Alchemy,Blacksmithing,Cooking,Enchanting,Engineering,FirstAid,Fishing,Herbalism,Inscription,Jewelcrafting,Leatherworking,Mining and Tailoring.\par

\b0\fs22 This line checks if the given #objectID is within #distance yards of the (x,y,z) coord.\par
Example:\par
\i Wait(\par
ObjectManager.GetObjectsOfType<WoWGameObject>().FirstOrDefault(o => o.Entry == 190536 ) != null && ObjectManager.GetObjectsOfType<WoWGameObject>().FirstOrDefault(o => o.Entry == 190536 ).Location.Distance(new WoWPoint(-8288.816, 1424.703, -0.01198259)) < 3\par
)\i0\par
Will wait until the the boat with objectID 190536 is within 3 yards of (-8288.816, 1424.703, -0.01198259).\par
This can be used for all boats and zeppelins. You can find the objectIDs and their coords in HB Developer Tools.\par
